# EquiLeader
#### Find the index S such that the leaders of the sequences A[0], A[1], ..., A[S] and A[S + 1], A[S + 2], ..., A[N - 1] are the same.

A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given.

The leader of this array is the value that occurs in more than half of the elements of A.

An equi leader is an index S such that 0 ≤ S < N − 1 and two sequences A[0], A[1], ..., A[S] and A[S + 1], A[S + 2], ..., A[N − 1] have leaders of the same value.

For example, given array A such that:

    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 3
    A[2] = 4
    A[3] = 4
    A[4] = 4
    A[5] = 2
we can find two equi leaders:

- 0, because sequences: (4) and (3, 4, 4, 4, 2) have the same leader, whose value is 4.
- 2, because sequences: (4, 3, 4) and (4, 4, 2) have the same leader, whose value is 4.

The goal is to count the number of equi leaders.

Write a function:

    function solution(A);

that, given a non-empty array A consisting of N integers, returns the number of equi leaders.

For example, given:

    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 3
    A[2] = 4
    A[3] = 4
    A[4] = 4
    A[5] = 2
the function should return 2, as explained above.

Write an **efficient** algorithm for the following assumptions:

- N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
- each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000,000,000..1,000,000,000].


```javascript
function solution(A){
    const N = A.length;
    const arr = [];
    let leaderNum = 0;
    let leader;

    if (N < 2){
        return 0;
    }

    //Get leader and leaderNum
    for (let i = 0; i < N; i++){
        if (!arr[A[i]]){
            arr[A[i]] = 1;
        }else{
            arr[A[i]] += 1;
        }
        if (arr[A[i]] > leaderNum){
            leaderNum = arr[A[i]];
            leader = A[i];
        }
    }
    if (leaderNum <= N / 2){
        return 0;
    }

    let leaderAcc = 0;
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < N; i++){
        if (A[i] === leader){
            leaderAcc++;
        }
        if (leaderAcc > (i + 1) / 2 && (leaderNum - leaderAcc) > (N - i - 1)/2){
            count++;
        }
    } 

    return count;
}
```
