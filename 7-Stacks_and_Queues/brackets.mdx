#### Determine whether a given string of parentheses (multiple types) is properly nested.

A string S consisting of N characters is considered to be properly nested if any of the following conditions is true:

- S is empty;
- S has the form "(U)" or "[U]" or "{U}" where U is a properly nested string;
- S has the form "VW" where V and W are properly nested strings.

For example, the string "{[()()]}" is properly nested but "([)()]" is not.

Write a function:

    function solution(S);

that, given a string S consisting of N characters, returns 1 if S is properly nested and 0 otherwise.

For example, given S = "{[()()]}", the function should return 1 and given S = "([)()]", the function should return 0, as explained above.

Write an **efficient** algorithm for the following assumptions:

- N is an integer within the range [0..200,000];
- string S is made only of the following characters: '(', '{', '[', ']', '}' and/or ')'.


```javascript
function solution(S){
    const bracketsObj = {};
    bracketsObj['('] = ')';
    bracketsObj['['] = ']';
    bracketsObj['{'] = '}';
    const leftBrackets = Object.keys(bracketsObj);
    const N = S.length;
    const arr = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < N; i++){
        if (leftBrackets.indexOf(S[i]) > -1){
            arr.push(S[i]);
        }else{
            if (bracketsObj[arr[arr.length-1]] == S[i]){
                arr.pop();
            }else{
                return 0;
            }
        }
    }
    if (arr.length > 0){
        return 0;
    }
    return 1;
}
```
