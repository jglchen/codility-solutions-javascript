# CountNonDivisible
#### Calculate the number of elements of an array that are not divisors of each element.

You are given an array A consisting of N integers.

For each number A[i] such that 0 â‰¤ i < N, we want to count the number of elements of the array that are not the divisors of A[i]. We say that these elements are non-divisors.

For example, consider integer N = 5 and array A such that:

    A[0] = 3
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 2
    A[3] = 3
    A[4] = 6
For the following elements:

- A[0] = 3, the non-divisors are: 2, 6,
- A[1] = 1, the non-divisors are: 3, 2, 3, 6,
- A[2] = 2, the non-divisors are: 3, 3, 6,
- A[3] = 3, the non-divisors are: 2, 6,
- A[4] = 6, there aren't any non-divisors.

Write a function:

    function solution(A);

that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns a sequence of integers representing the amount of non-divisors.

Result array should be returned as an array of integers.

For example, given:

    A[0] = 3
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 2
    A[3] = 3
    A[4] = 6
the function should return [2, 4, 3, 2, 0], as explained above.

Write an **efficient** algorithm for the following assumptions:

- N is an integer within the range [1..50,000];
- each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..2 * N].

```javascript
function solution(A){
    const N = A.length;
    const obj = {};
    for (let i = 0; i < N; i++){
        if (!obj[A[i]]){
            obj[A[i]] = {count: 1, divisors: -1};
        }else{
            let count = obj[A[i]].count;
            count++;
            obj[A[i]] = {...obj[A[i]], count: count};
        }
    }

    const keysArr = Object.keys(obj);
    const keysLen = keysArr.length;
    for (let i = 0; i < keysLen; i++){
        const n = +keysArr[i];
        let divisorsCount = 0;
        let j = 1;
        while (j * j < n){
            if (n % j == 0){
                if (obj[j]){
                    divisorsCount += obj[j].count;
                }
                if (obj[n/j]){
                    divisorsCount += obj[n/j].count;
                }
            }
            j++;
        }
        if (j * j == n){
            if (obj[j]){
                divisorsCount += obj[j].count;
            }
        }
        obj[n] = {...obj[n], divisors: divisorsCount};
    }
    const result = A.map(item => N - obj[item].divisors);
    return result;
}
```
